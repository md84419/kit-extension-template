Feature: stats
    As Signly Operations Manager
    I want to be able to quickly and easily get key statics for the Sequencer / Morpheme service
    So that I can monitor the number of bigMorpheme IDs recognised by the service, the number that are mapped to
    bigMorpheme animations for Unreal and USD render pipelines and identify any areas of concern and any 
    differences and changes that are different, odd, unusual or distinctive.

    Scenario: /stats Endpoint returns a JSON file containing key stats
    #   Given a running service
    #   When we GET the /stats Endpoint
    #   Then we get a response of type application/JSON
    #   And we get a JSON document in the body of the response
    #   And the JSON document is valid
    #   And the JSON document contains stats
    #   And the status code is 200
